<strong><p> Welcome to my website! Here you can find a bunch of information about me just by clicking around.
  This includes info on various projects Ive worked on as well as contact details. </p> </strong>
  <h1> About Me </h1>
  <p> I am currently in my first year at Robert Gordon University where I am studying Cyber Security
   (it sounds dead cool I know). In my spare time I enjoy doing charity work which includes building homes for the homeless
   and helping little old ladies cross the street. Last weekend I managed to build three brand new homes as well as
   raising money for the "Christmas Presents for Dogs" Fund. </p>
